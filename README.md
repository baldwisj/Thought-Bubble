# Thought-Bubble

This application acts as a social network app, allowing users to be created, add friends, post thoughts, react on thoughts, and delete thoughts, reactions and users.

## Description
This applicaiton was build with my knowlege of mongoDB and mongoose. It uses these back-end packages to manipulate and move dataq from the user to and from the server/database. It does not have front end capabilities, instead, it used insomina to make the CRUD commands.

## Usage
This app allows the user to run commands in insomnia. The user can create a user for themselves, add friends, add thoughts, and react on other users posts by executing insomina CRUD commands using primarly id properties in the url.

## Conclusion
Durning my creation of this webpage I have learned and sharpened many of my coding skills. These skills include:

* I acheived a better unserstanding of MongoDB data base structure in conjucntion with Compass.

* I enhansed my abilities with mongoose as an alternative to sequalize in earlier classes.

* I futhered by understanding of proper file structure and the path an application makes thought those files to execute the desired function.

* I further familiarized myself with insomnia and using CRUD requests within that application.
